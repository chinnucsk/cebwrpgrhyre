============

Solutions to problems from a website named after a fameous mathemetican (name not mentioned because of google).
All solutions to this date are written in Erlang and are usually involked using escript. Most problems solve fairly quickly but sometimes an increase in speed can be gained by using the -n flag, forcing native compilation of the code.
