% Using euler22data.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, 
% begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. 
% Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
% For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. 
% So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714. What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

-mode(compile).

-define(ASCII_ALPHA_DIFF, 64). % The diff between a names ascii decimal value and its alphabetical "score".
